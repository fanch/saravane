Libraries and utilities used for parsing XML files.
Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project 
(but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available 
under the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages,
i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to the 
content using extra "markup" information enclosed between angle brackets. 
HTML is the most well-known markup language. 
Though the library is written in C a variety of language bindings 
make it available in other environments.
