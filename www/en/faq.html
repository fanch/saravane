  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
   <h2>The installer doesn't allow to have a separate partition for the /home for example</h2>
    <div><p>This question have so many time been ask, I will try to bring as much arguments as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div><p>Today, a user use very often a lot of data and big amount of data, the size of the personal folder can get very quick big. MP3, photos, videos are normally quite big ones. Imagines that you have a 25' bytes hard disk. You said OK I take 100 G for the system and 150 for my datas. Great you just cut your disk in two pieces and the data partition will be quicker full then if you would have kept one partition. So if we could avoid to have to cut the hard disk in partitions while we could be able to reinstall as much as we want NuTyX without having to think of our datas that would be great. <u>That's exactly the idea of the NuTyX installer</u>.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
    <li>The installer will nevel format a partition allready formated without a manual intervention.</li>
    <li>If you have a distribution (NuTyX or any other) with your personnal datas and the system is on the same partition, during the installation process, the installer will tell you that there is allready a distribution but will not ask for format the partition. You will need to delete the folders <b>  /var,/proc,/sys,/usr,/sbin,/etc </b> but will not touch the other folders like <b>/home, /MP3,</b> etc. So yours datas are untouch.</li>
    <li>Today it's very easy to configure a file server based on NFS, so users could have they home folder remotly on this server.</li>
    <li>Let's summarise, we can say that create a partition for your home today is unecessary, at least with NuTyX. We could wonder why the "apple" operating system never recommand this.</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Is it possible to upgrade NuTyX sekong to NuTyX saravane without reinstalling everything ?</h2>
    <div><p>No. The number of changes is too big. The package manager has change, the initrd has change, the installer has change, the ports location has change, etc</p>
